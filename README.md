# React Notepad

### What is this?

This is a simple notepad app made using [React](https://react.dev/)/[Vite](https://vite.dev/) alongside an ([expressServer](https://expressjs.com/)), just as simple practice for how to use the [React](https://react.dev/) framework. This is a very simple program, you can register/login a user and make basic notes.

# How to run this?

### Requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
- That's it really.

To run the frontend (React/Vite)/backend ([express](https://expressjs.com/)) just run these commands:

```
npm i && npm run dev
```

And that's it, you can test this app by just going to localhost in your browser. Keep in mind that you are meant to run both the frontend and backend for the app to work.
